# PHP version handling follows:
#
# There are three states a PHP version can be in. A version must only appear in
# one list below.
#
# Supported: the API number appears in $PHP_API_VERSIONS. These versions will
#            always be installed, and the .so will be removed on both upgrade
#            and uninstallation.
#
# Deprecated: the API number appears in $DEPRECATED_PHP_API_VERSIONS. These
#             versions will always be installed, but the .so will NOT be removed
#             on upgrade, since the expectation is that the version will no
#             longer appear in $PHP_API_VERSIONS thereafter.
#
# Unsupported: the API number appears in $UNSUPPORTED_PHP_API_VERSIONS. These
#              versions were supported once upon a time, but are no longer
#              supported.
#
# What this really means to you, the developer, if and when you're changing the
# agent's version support:
#
# Adding a version: add the new API number to $PHP_API_VERSIONS. Test it. Be
#                   of good cheer.
#
# Removing a version: for one release, remove the API number from
#                     $PHP_API_VERSIONS and add it to
#                     $DEPRECATED_PHP_API_VERSIONS. Document loudly that
#                     customers using that PHP version should pin to that
#                     package version. For the subsequent release, remove the
#                     version from $DEPRECATED_PHP_API_VERSIONS and add it to
#                     $UNSUPPORTED_PHP_API_VERSIONS.
