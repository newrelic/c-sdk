# C SDK Roadmap

## Archival Notice ##
As of June 30 2022 we are archiving the C-SDK project. Please explore the [option to use OpenTelemetry](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/c-sdk/get-started/otel_cpp_example/) as an alternative to send C++ telemetry data to New Relic. For more details, see our [Explorers Hub announcement](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).

## Product Vision
The goal of the C SDK is to provide visibility into the health of your service. The agent provides metrics about the runtime health of your service and the process it runs in, and traces that show how specific requests are performing. It also provides information about the environment in which it is running, so you can identify issues with specific hosts, regions, deployments, and other facets.
