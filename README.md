# New Relic C SDK

This is the New Relic C SDK! If your application does not use other New Relic 
APM agent languages, you can use the C SDK to take advantage of New Relic's
monitoring capabilities and features to instrument a wide range of applications.

## Requirements

The C SDK works on 64-bit Linux operating systems with:

* gcc 4.8 or higher
* glibc 2.17 or higher
* Kernel version 2.6.26 or higher
* libpcre 8.20 or higher
* libpthread

Running unit tests requires cmake 2.8 or higher.

Compiling the New Relic daemon requires Go 1.7 or higher.

## Building the C SDK

If your system meets the requirements, building the C SDK and 
daemon should be as simple as:

```sh
make
```

This will create two files in this directory:

* `libnewrelic.a`: the static C SDK library, ready to link against.
* `newrelic-daemon`: the daemon binary, ready to run.

You can start the daemon in the foreground with:

```sh
./newrelic-daemon -f --logfile stdout --loglevel debug
```

Then you can invoke your instrumented application.  Your application,
which makes C SDK API calls, reports data to the daemon over a socket;
in turn, the daemon reports the data to New Relic.


## Tests

To compile and run the unit tests:

```sh
make run_tests
```

Or, just to compile them:

```sh
make tests
```
